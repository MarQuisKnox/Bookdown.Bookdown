# Contributing

We are happy to review any contributions you want to make. When contributing, please:

- Fork from, and compare pull requests against, the `develop` branch.

- Adhere to the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

- Include tests. We strive for 100% test coverage at all times.

- Describe any backwards-compatiblity breaking changes. As the project is still unstable, BC breaks are not as critical, but they are important to note.

The time between submitting a contribution and its review one may be extensive; do not be discouraged if there is not immediate feedback. Thanks!
